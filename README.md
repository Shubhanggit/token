SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT TOKEN
The MyToken Solidity contract defines a simple Ethereum token with the name "HELLO" and the abbreviation "HE".
It tracks the total supply of the token and the balances of each address using a mapping. The contract includes two main functions: mint and burn.
The mint function allows the creation of new tokens, which are added to a specified address, increasing the total supply.
The burn function enables the destruction of tokens from a specified address, reducing the total supply.
Both functions have safeguards to prevent operations involving the zero address, ensuring that minting and burning are performed only with valid addresses
